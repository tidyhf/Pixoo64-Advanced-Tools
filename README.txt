Installation Instructions:
Step 1: Download & Install Python
This is the most important step:
On the first screen of the installer, make sure you check the box at the bottom that says "Add Python to PATH".

Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Make sure the Pixoo64Tools.py script and the requirements.txt file are in the same folder.

In a Command Prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved the script. A simple way to do this is to type cd followed by a space, and then drag the folder from your File Explorer directly into the Command Prompt window. It will paste the full path for you.
It should look something like this:
cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\Pixoo-64-Advanced-Tools

Press Enter.

Now that you are in the correct folder, copy and paste the following command into the Command Prompt and press Enter:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Run the Application!
In the same Command Prompt window (and in the same folder), simply type the following command and press Enter:
python Pixoo64Tools.py

\\\ To grab your Pixoo64's IP address on the Divoom app tap the top left + next to gallery and tap 'Settings' on your Pixoo64

The first time you successfully connect to your Pixoo's IP address, the app will save it for you so you don't have to enter it every time.
