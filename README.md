## ðŸ”§ Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Download & Install Python
This is the most important step. On the Python installer, make sure you check the box at the bottom that says **"Add Python to PATH"**.

You can download the latest version of Python here: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Make sure the `Pixoo64Tools.py` script and the `requirements.txt` file are in the same folder.

1. In a Command Prompt, navigate to that folder. An easy way is to type `cd ` and then drag the folder from your File Explorer into the window. It should look like this:
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\Pixoo-64-Advanced-Tools
    ```
2. Press **Enter**.

3. Now that you are in the correct folder, copy and paste the following command into the Command Prompt and press **Enter**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Step 3: Run the Application!
In the same Command Prompt window (and in the same folder), simply type the following command and press **Enter**:
```bash
python Pixoo64Tools.py
```

### Step 4: Finding Your Pixoo 64 IP Address
To grab your Pixoo 64's IP address on the Divoom app, tap the top-left + next to "Gallery" and then tap 'Settings' on your Pixoo 64.

> ðŸ’¡ Note: The first time you successfully connect to your Pixoo's IP address, the app will save it for you so you don't have to enter it every time.
